# Old-fashioned way
If you'd rather do this the old-fashioned way and add this repo as an upstream remote:

1.  Create a new repo at `<new-url>`
1.  `git clone <new-url> <new-repo>`
1.  `cd <new-repo>`
1.  `git remote add upstream https://github.com/mbh95/ts-starter.git`
1.  `git pull upstream master`
1.  `git push origin master`
